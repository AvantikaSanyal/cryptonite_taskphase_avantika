# Power Cookie

flag :  picoCTF{gr4d3_A_c00k13_0d351e23}

## My Approach :

I go to the website and I inspect it.                         
It doesn't allow me to login because I didn't have permissions
I go to the cookies section (as the name of the challenge says cookie) and see the following :

Certain value is set to 0                             
I change it to 1

I reload my page and got the flag.
