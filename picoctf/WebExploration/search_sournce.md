flag : picoCTF{1nsp3ti0n_0f_w3bpag3s_ec95fa49}

## My Approach
The challenge read : *The developer of this website mistakenly left an important artifact in the website source, can you find it?*              
So I went to the website, it was a yoga ad page or something

As the challenge said something was in the source, I went and individually inspected all the codes in the source and the flag was there
