# Insp3ct0r 

flag : picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?832b0699}

Hint : There's 3 parts

## My Approach :
- I went to the given link : https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/41511/                        
- Then I went to Inspect the page.
- There we had three codes under source
- On inspecting the three codes, I found the flag in three separate parts

## Errors 
Initially I took the flag to be picoCTF{tru3_d3_t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?832b0699} as given, but that was coming as incorrecy. So I removed that gap because detective is one word.
