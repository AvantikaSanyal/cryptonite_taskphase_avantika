## My Approach

I saw the hint which said : "How did pictures from the moon landing get sent back to Earth?"

I simply played the audio while the app was on, it was in some Scottie1 mode. It gave me the following image :

Voila, we win, once again.

## What did I learn?

SSTV stands for slow-scan television.   A literal term for SSTV is narrowband television. Analog broadcast television requires at least 6 MHz wide channels, because it transmits 25 or 30 picture frames per second, but SSTV usually only takes up to a maximum of 3 kHz of bandwidth. It is a much slower method of still picture transmission, usually taking from about eight seconds to a couple of minutes, depending on the mode used, to transmit one image frame.
