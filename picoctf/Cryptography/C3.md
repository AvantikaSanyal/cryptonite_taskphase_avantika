## My Approach
I put this code thru ChatGPT and got that this is an *encoder* which works with the logic
 Mapping Direction:

- lookup1 is the set of input characters.
- lookup2 is the set of output characters.
 The code transforms characters from lookup1 to lookup2.
```
cur = lookup1.index(char)
out += lookup2[(cur - prev) % 40]
prev = cur
```
- It takes a character from chars, finds its position in lookup1 (cur).
- The difference (cur - prev) % 40 determines the position in lookup2.
- The result is appended to out.

  Um okay, this barely made sense to me, so I input an example

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bcd33b9-0cab-4718-bbf5-1f4664044940)                        

Hmm, okay. Now what?
I need to reverse this?

So the reverse code is :
```
import sys
from fileinput import input

# Lookup tables
lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

# Initialize variables
out = ""
prev = 0

# Read encoded text from input (line by line)
chars = ""
for line in input():
    chars += line

# Decoding process
for char in chars:
    # Find the current character's index in lookup2 (encoded character set)
    cur = lookup2.index(char)
    
    # Reverse the encoding formula: (cur + prev) % 40 to get the original index in lookup1
    original_index = (cur + prev) % 40
    
    # Append the corresponding character from lookup1 to the output
    out += lookup1[original_index]
    
    # Update prev for the next iteration
    prev = original_index

# Output the decoded text
sys.stdout.write(out)
```

Okay so now I have used the encoder to find the decoder, and I have a file called ciphertext which is gonna be my input for the decoder.        
So, to run the decoder code with cipher text as input I used the command on termincal :
```
python3 convertback.py < ciphertext
```
and the output I got is :
```
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1
```
Oh, okay.
Now, ill try using this new code with Ciphertext as input?
```
cat ciphertext | python3 convertback.py > newcode.py
python3 newcode.py
```

## What I learnt
1. How to understand an encoder
2. How to make a decoder from an encoder

## Errors
1. I had to edit the code using nano editor because I didnt put parantheses
