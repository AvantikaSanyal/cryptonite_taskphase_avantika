# QUENCH YOUR THIRST
we had a cipher that i put in thru an online decoder using the last part "DLLWB://RGLM.QZ/TUZIOYPJ" as a key. It gave me a huge text of
AS THE PROTAGONIST STUMBLED INTO THE HEART OF THE IOIS TRAP THE WALLS AROUND HIM FLICKERED WITH SCORCHING HEAT A MASSIVE IMPENETRABLE FIREWALL ROARED IN EVERY DIRECTION CUTTING OFF HIS 
ESCAPE THE IOI HAD ANTICIPATED HIS INFILTRATION AND THIS WAS THEIR FINAL GAMBIT TO STOP HIM BUT ARTEMIS HAD LEFT HIM WITH A GIFT A COMPUTER TERMINAL IN THE CENTER OF THE CHAMBER THE SCREEN 
BLINKED TO LIFE AWAITING INPUT WITH A FLASH OF INSPIRATION HE REALISED WHAT HE NEEDED TO DO ADMIN PRIVILEGES HAD BEEN UNLOCKED THE COMMANDS HE EGGSECUTED HERE COULD DISMANTLE THE FIREWALL AND
ALLOW HIM TO REACH THE HEART OF THE VIRUS IF HE FOLLOWED THE CORRECT ORDER THE LIST OF ADMIN COMMANDS APPEARED ON THE SCREEN ADMIN COMMAND LIST FIREWALL BYPASS 1 VERIFY THE CURRENT STATUS OF 
THE FIREWALL SCANNING FOR VULNERABILITIES IN THE DEFENSE SYSTEMS 2 DISABLE THE FIREWALLS AUTOREPAIR MECHANISM WHICH REGENERATES ANY BREACHED SECTIONS 3 DISPLAY ALL ACTIVE FIREWALL LAYERS THIS
REVEALS THE NUMBER OF DEFENSIVE LAYERS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE CONFIGURATIONS 4 MANUALLY DISABLE THE THIRD FIREWALL LAYER WHICH HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE STRONGEST BARRIER PROTECTING THE CORE 5
SCAN FOR MALICIOUS PATTERNS THAT MIGHT BE HIDDEN INSIDE THE FIREWALL CODE THIS HELPS NEUTRALISE ANY TRAPS LAID BY IOI 6 ISOLATE THE SIGNATURE FILE USED BY IOI TO SUSTAIN THE FIREWALLS INTEGRITY
7 OVERRIDE THE FIREWALLS ENCRYPTION WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL ADMIN PRIVILEGES BREAKING IOIS CONTROL OVER IT 8 EGGSECUTE A COMPLETE SHUTDOWN OF ALL FIREWALL LAYERS LEAVING THE SYSTEM UNPROTECTED
FOR A BRIEF MOMENT 9 RESET THE ACCESS CONTROLS TO OASIS GATEWAYS ALLOWING UNRESTRICTED MOVEMENT THROUGH THE SERVERS THE TERMINAL BEEPED WITH EACH SUCCESSFUL COMMAND EGGSECUTION AND THE HEAT
AROUND HIM BEGAN TO FADE WITH EVERY FIREWALL LAYER DEACTIVATED THE PATH FORWARD BECAME CLEARER HE WAS ALMOST THROUGH ONLY ONE FINAL COMMAND TO DISABLE THE LAST OF IOIS TRAPS AND HE WOULD HAVE
ACCESS TO THE VIRUS CONTROLS THE FATE OF THE OASIS WAS NOW IN HIS HANDS HTTPS://KATB.IN/YZNJORXQ 
The last link was not working. Here i received a hint from my friend who said check the letters which are repeated only once. So we dtarted trying every combination we could think of by changing
Y,Q,Z,J and finally got to HTTPS://KATB.IN/YXNZORQJ. 

# NOM NOM
On discord there was a hint, let the pac man nom nom you. So i was like "ew why are the controls reversed". Then i tried clicking around everywhere, nothing worked. I thought "wonder why dont I
have access to the game". Then it said "Only admin has the right to play". So right clicked, inspect, cookies.
application --> cookies  --> admin
Here i saw something was given as false, I simply made it true and it worked.


# NOT NOICE
here we opened the file in an online audio file visualiser and it gave us the key in a spectrography form and we just read that

# MAZE RUNNER
Reverse google searched the picture of the image, theen the person who created the image came up, then the guy who he was insipred from came up

# KNOCK KNOCK 
Here my friend downloaded the pic, then opened it on MS Paint and erased the distortions and scanned it.

# MICROSOFT STRONG EDGE
The answer was in the first slide. In tthe corner there was a point sized image. My friend decoded it using rot13 online
