## My Approach :
1. At first we reverse searched the image and found that the place was the DLF Belvedere Towers in Gurgaon.
2. Then we looked up shopping complexes near said location and found *The Cyberhub*.
3. Then we looked for any significant ad we could find from images.
4. Initially we thought it was TheBigWaveEvents but it wouldn't accept the flag in any format
5. Then we found a Hyundai Ad. So the company name was set
6. Then we looked up for concerts in India on the 26th of October, 2024 and found we had Shankar, Ehsaan and Leroy performing
7. This is a post on Facebook that Hyundai had made :

8. That solved everything for us.

## Errors :
We at first thought it was this

but the flag wasn't going in so we looked for other options
